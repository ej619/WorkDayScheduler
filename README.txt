## Work_Day_Scheduler

- My motivation in building a Day Schedule is to get better at JavaScripting.
- I built this Work Day Schedule to allow myself to see my work day with colored time slots that are past, present, and future colored.
- I learned a little JavaScripting.

## User Story
```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to create a workday calendar to help me see my day on a webpage with colored time slots so that I can find the current time quickly and futer time as well.
SO THAT I can manage my time.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Usage

To use the Work Day Schedule, type an event in a time slot and click the save button. You can also see the current time in red. Future time will be in green and past time is in grey.  If you refresh the page you will retain your input from the storage.
